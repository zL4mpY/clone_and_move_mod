# Clone And Move Mod
Was it annoying to you to click Copy + Paste and move buttons everytime you wanted to clone an object and move it to the right by 1 block? If yes, this mod fixes this issue by adding 4 more buttons in edit tab, which allows you to clone an object and move it in any direction in 1 click.

## Description
This mod adds 4 new buttons which allow you to copy and paste and then move object in any direction in 1 click.
This mod may be useless on PC but useful on mobile.

## How to use
1. Place some object or select the existing ones.
2. Go to Edit tab in bottom editor menu.
3. Find 4 new move buttons which have the texture of a move button combined with a copy button.
4. Click the button you need.
5. The selected objects should be copied and pasted and moved in the direction of the button you have clicked.

## Compatibility
The mod should work fine with BetterEdit, though I haven't figured out how can I make the buttons be added after BetterEdit move buttons yet, so they appear between 1/2 and 1/4 move buttons.
