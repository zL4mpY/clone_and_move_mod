# Clone And Move Mod

Was it annoying to you to click Copy + Paste and move buttons everytime you wanted to clone an object and move it to the right by 1 block? If yes, this mod fixes this issue by adding 4 more buttons in edit tab, which allows you to clone an object and move it in any direction in 1 click.

I made this mod mainly to make building on mobile devices easier, because I had this issue.
