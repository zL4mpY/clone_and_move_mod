# Clone and Move Mod
This Geometry Dash mod adds 4 new buttons which allow you to copy and paste and then move object in any direction in 1 click.
This mod may be useless on PC but useful on mobile.

## How to use
1. Place some object or select the existing ones.
2. Go to Edit tab in bottom editor menu.
3. Find 4 new move buttons which have the texture of a move button combined with a copy button.
4. Click the button you need.
5. The selected objects should be copied and pasted and moved in the direction of the button you have clicked.

## Compatibility
The mod should work fine with [BetterEdit](https://github.com/HJfod/BetterEdit), though I haven't figured out how can I make the buttons be added after [BetterEdit](https://github.com/HJfod/BetterEdit) move buttons so they appear between 1/2 and 1/4 move buttons.

## Build instructions
```sh
# Assuming you have the Geode CLI set up already
geode build
```

This is my first Geode mod and my first coding experience on C++ so I hope the mod is not very bad.
