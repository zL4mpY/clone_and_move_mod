# Clone and Move Mod
This Geometry Dash mod adds 4 new buttons which allow you to copy and paste and then move object in any direction in 1 click.
This mod may be useless on PC but useful on mobile.

## How to use
1. Place some object or select the existing ones.
2. Go to Edit tab in bottom editor menu.
3. Find 4 new move buttons which have the texture of a move button combined with a copy button.
4. Click the button you need.
5. The selected objects should be copied and pasted and moved in the direction of the button you have clicked.

## Compatibility
The mod works with [BetterEdit](mod:hjfod.betteredit). You can change the order of the buttons to make them appear before half move buttons or after all move buttons (including BetterEdit ones).

## Keybinds
The mod has its own keybinds, which are not configured by default. You can set the keybinds in the keybinds menu.

## Issues
If the mod has any issues or even makes the game crash, please let me know about it by creating an issue on [GitHub repository](https://github.com/zL4mpY/clone_and_move_mod) or writing me in Discord DMs (loovigmd).

## Build instructions

This is my first Geode mod and my first coding experience on C++ so I hope the mod is not very bad.
